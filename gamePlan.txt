get all player and npc party member names []

set sorcerer anger level to 0 []

go to merchant(assume gold is at 100) []

    side note: maybe use default constructor to initialize inventory and use inventory objs 
    to update and display merchant menu(see github)
    in either case, we only need one constructor

after party leaves merchant, initialize inventory with paramaterized constructor []
set the vectors separately

go on to print main menu, status, map, action menu []

STATUS UPDATE
    i am going to try to make a status update function in Inventory.cpp
    this way we can just call it in one line of code each turn

    MAP GENERATION
        print rooms first
        print npcs third, check for npcs, rooms, and mosters in positions, check for 0,0 (player should not spawn in a room)

Note: monsters are not printed on the map, seems like you only encounter them if you:
    1) go into a room
    2) get unlucky (20% chance each investigation of unexplored space you see a monster? see github)
    3) pick a fight (an option on actions menu for some reason)
    4) get a riddle wrong

Also, maybe we turn the merchant menu into an external function of sorts; it would make the 
price adjustments based on rooms cleared a lot easier i think, plus make program easier to 
read

further, we should maybe reconsider how the weapons menu and assignment works; atm i just assign
a weapon to the first player, then increment which player to give the next weapon to.
 This works well enough for the first weapon, but we should add something to buy a weapon
 for a specific member of the party for when we meet merchants in the wild

nico: monster fight, misfortune calculator, riddle

ryan: exploration map shit, rooms

We have to make a point system so that we can write to a file that keeps track and organizes the playthrough score and outputs a leaderboard 

We have to write a function that cooks food and calculates if the cookware breaks 

add odds to monster fight
