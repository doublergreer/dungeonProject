get all player and npc party member names []

set sorcerer anger level to 0 []

go to merchant(assume gold is at 100) []

    side note: maybe use default constructor to initialize inventory and use inventory objs 
    to update and display merchant menu(see github)
    in either case, we only need one constructor

after party leaves merchant, initialize inventory with paramaterized constructor []
set the vectors separately

go on to print main menu, status, map, action menu []
