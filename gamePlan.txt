get all player and npc party member names []

set sorcerer anger level to 0 []

go to merchant(assume gold is at 100) []

    side note: maybe use default constructor to initialize inventory and use inventory objs 
    to update and display merchant menu(see github)
    in either case, we only need one constructor

after party leaves merchant, initialize inventory with paramaterized constructor []
set the vectors separately

go on to print main menu, status, map, action menu []

    MAP GENERATION
        print rooms first
        print npcs third, check for npcs, rooms, and mosters in positions, check for 0,0 (player should not spawn in a room)

Note: monsters are not printed on the map, seems like you only encounter them if you:
    1) go into a room
    2) get unlucky (20% chance each investigation of unexplored space you see a monster? see github)
    3) pick a fight (an option on actions menu for some reason)
    4) get a riddle wrong

//nico: monster fight, misfortune calculator, riddle

//ryan: exploration map shit

rooms

We have to make a point system so that we can write to a file that keeps track and organizes the playthrough score and outputs a leaderboard 

We have to write a function that cooks food and calculates if the cookware breaks 

//add odds to monster fight 

    when buying armor, make sure to update Member.has_armor_!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

problem at aliveatlevel func, breaks monsterfight

when we finish the game, we should make sure it is explained well to the player in the starting menu

    If the team size is not enough to complete the journey (at least one person besides the team leader), the game ends !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

we need to add treasure selling to merchant menu function

You should also save the final stats of the game in a file named results.txt. You can choose the format of this file.

KEEP TRACK OF ARMOR FOR DEATHS AND SUCH

WIZARD ANGER

find where to check that at least 2 players are alive (maybe end of turn)
^player 0 + another player

//Make a scenerio if the player tries to get into a room withough a key 

add who has armor to printInv
