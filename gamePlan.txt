get all player and npc party member names []

set sorcerer anger level to 0 []

go to merchant(assume gold is at 100) []

    side note: maybe use default constructor to initialize inventory and use inventory objs 
    to update and display merchant menu(see github)
    in either case, we only need one constructor

after party leaves merchant, initialize inventory with paramaterized constructor []
set the vectors separately

go on to print main menu, status, map, action menu []


    MAP GENERATION
        print rooms first
        print npcs third, check for npcs, rooms, and mosters in positions, check for 0,0 (player should not spawn in a room)

Note: monsters are not printed on the map, seems like you only encounter them if you:
    1) go into a room
    2) get unlucky (20% chance each investigation of unexplored space you see a monster? see github)
    3) pick a fight (an option on actions menu for some reason)
